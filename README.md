### MySmart Cal - A cloud-based public calendar
Time is precious. People who value time should always try their best to improve
their productivity. Be it a freelancing activity or free community service, it is often difficult
for people offering the services to coordinate the right time window and location with the
people who need to utilize their services. What if there exists a simple application that
solves the problem of finding the correct matches? What if a person likes to volunteer for
community service and could add their available free time on a public platform so that the
needy can book their appointment? Yes, the Smart Cal application is an innovative solution
that uses technology to solve this problem.

Finding and keeping clients is the first and most difficult challenge for freelancers
or service providers (users in other words). It is also a never-ending task. For example, a
software engineer, who wants to offer career guidance to the students preparing for coding
interviews in his available time, has no platform to connect with them. This often becomes
a challenge, but it can be overcome by maintaining transparency in time and commitments
between the clients and users.

To address the discussed problem, we are implementing a shared calendar
application, Smart Cal. Users and the clients who employ them are the two personae of this
application. Users can specify their services and available hours. Employers or clients can
search for required services and schedule an appointment. Other common functionalities,
such as editing existing appointments, searching for a freelancer or service provider,
managing availability, etc., will be part of our application. This application will act as a
bridge between freelancers and clients to manage their work and time effectively.
